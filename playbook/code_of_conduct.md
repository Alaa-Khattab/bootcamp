# Code of Conduct

GSG is a collaborative, peer-led learning environment. This means taking an interest in and conducting yourself to the benefit of everyone around you's learning:

- Arrive at 08:45 to be ready for a prompt start at 9:00 and let the group know (in advance, if possible) if you’re not going to be in, **as if you don’t others will be delayed by your absence.**
- GSG has a hotdesking policy. Please sit anywhere when you arrive each morning, not at the same desk, and aim to work with a different person each day – **we all have different skills to share and learn from.**
- We ❤️ pair programming. Don't work on your own, and aim for equal contribution and mutual understanding of the code in group projects; **the success of most projects is dependent upon how well you work as a team.**
- Don't stress over completing projects. It's okay if you present something unfinished as **it's a learning exercise, and we’re not in competition with each other.**
- GSG bootcamp is built on an ethos of peer learning. Work hard on readmes and group resources, and ensure you code review others' projects – **you’re depriving yourself and others from benefiting from each other’s work otherwise.**
- Struggle is good, but not too much of it. If you cannot solve a problem within 20 minutes, stop and talk to somebody about it, **as chances are someone can help.**
Tidy up after yourself and take care of the space, because **we all have to work here:**
  - Please leave your desk clear before you leave each day.
- For the first 4 weeks of the course, **stick to vanilla JavaScript.** That means no frameworks, backend or frontend (i.e. no Bootstrap/jQuery etc...). This is for the benefit of your understanding of JavaScript; trust us – it works!
